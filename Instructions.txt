
Before you start:

1.	Set up an account on bitbucket.org.
2.	Create a repository called ‘Aviva Fizz Buzz name’ where name is your own name.
3.	Share the repository with tony.harding@aviva.com , lee.powell@aviva.com , tim.page@aviva.com
4.	Use create-react-app (https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to scaffold a basic React application, and commit it to source control.

The application:

•         Should be correctly architected, as if this was a production application.
•         Should be built using a 'test first’ methodology.
•         It is not important that you complete every step in the exercise.
•         It is important that all submitted code is of good quality. Refactor as necessary.

Check in your code to Bitbucket regularly.
Also, try to commit your code after every step, and label it ‘Step 1’, ‘Step 2’ etc.
1.     Basic Fizz-Buzz:
a.     The user should be able to enter a positive integer.
b.     You should print out, in a vertical list, all of the values between 1 and the entered value.
c.     Where the number is divisible by 3, you should instead print ‘fizz’.
d.     Where the number is divisible by 5, you should instead print 'buzz'.
e.     Where the number is divisible by 3 AND 5, you should instead print ‘fizz buzz’.
2.     Add validation to ensure the entered value is an integer between 1 and 1000.
3.     Add styling so 'fizz' is printed in blue, and 'buzz' in green.
4.     Change the logic so that if today is Wednesday, the words 'wizz' (in blue) and ‘wuzz' (in green) are substituted for 'fizz' and 'buzz'. 
5.     Amend the application so only 20 values are displayed at a time. Implement ‘Next’ and ‘Previous’ buttons to display the remaining values.
