2.       Please create a sample app using TS and Knockout which consists of

a.       Complete HTML and CSS RWD app

Please ignore bitbucket account creation, you can create locally and upload that to FTS and share link with me.

 

Please make sure your app should be properly indented and aligned.

 

Please let me know if you need anything more information.

 

Note: Primarily focusing on React App.
